# Today I Learned...

One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of some lesson learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject.

## Tasks

Every Monday and Friday, write an entry in your learning journal. On Mondays, include your expectations for the week. And on Friday, reflect on how your week went. In addition, document things that you've learned as well as your experience learning them. Your entry may contain code samples, links to additional resources you found, or anything else you feel is relevant. We have found a correlation between students who write consistently in their journals, and student who succeed in class. Take this assignment seriously.


- Create a gist with the file name `daily-learning-journal.md`. You can make it a public or private gist.
- Add a Table of Content (see the example for how to do this)
- For each entry, add an `h1` header with at least the class number. You can include the date and an actual title if you'd like. Write your entry underneath this header.
- Write to your heart's content. Write about what you learned, what may or may not have happened in group work, what you're hoping for, etc. This is for your own reflection more than it is just another thing for us to assess you on.

See "sample-LJ.md" for an idea of how it should look.


## Submitting Your Work
