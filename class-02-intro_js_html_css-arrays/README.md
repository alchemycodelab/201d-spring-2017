# Class 2: Basics of JS and HTML, including Arrays; CSS Introduction

<a id="top"></a>
# Today's Plan: Week 1, Tuesday Lecture

#### Quiz 1 will be published this afternoon. It will be due at 11:59pm tomorrow night (late Wednesday)

#### Class Roadmap for Today
- (Kind of) Code review
- [Topics from JS readings](#js)
- [Topics from CSS readings](#css) 
- [Learning Journal](#lj)
- [Review lab assignment, code demo, `git clone`](#code)

#### Announcements:
- Finished your lab early? Here are some thing you can do to take advantage of your time here:
  - Talk to your peers! Ask them to explain something in their code to you, or to explain something to them.
  - Research a question you heard or thought of during lecture that we didn't have the time to address (and share your findings with the class.)
  - Read documentation, or practice reading code.
  - Grab a friend and do some whiteboarding practice. We'll work on finding some problems for you.
- The goal of your lab is for you to explore and practice! Even though week one's project is fairly simple, it can be as impressive and portfolio-worthy as you make it.
- Book share? Who likes having their physical books to reference?
 - Quiz 1 will be published this afternoon, and it will be due by 11:59pm Wednesday. More about quizzes:
 	- Note that there will be some quiz content from time to time that we may not have covered yet for instance something on the quiz published today that we do not cover until tomorrow.
 	- Keep in mind that you have unlimited re-takes on the quizzes, and also that the quizzes are designed to be treated like they are open-book. It's more about what you can figure out than what you have memorized.
	- Also, note that the quizzes have two main purposes:
  			1. To get you to re-engage with the content in a different way, reinforcing your knowledge.
  			2. To help you prepare for the Code 301 entrance exam, which you will take at the end of Week 3. There is a minimum threshold you must pass on that exam (70%), and also, that exam factors into your grade in this class.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 2 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of the fundamental structures of HTML, including `<DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, and `<script>`, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and make use of assorted data types such as booleans, strings, integers, floats in JavaScript, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and make use of introductory CSS concepts and techniques from Chapter 10 of the textbook, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Be able to successfully manage a code project in the command line by using Git branches and by doing pushes and pulls to/from a repository on GitHub.

## Live code

In our code demo today we'll be doing the following:
- Install a JS Linter in VS Code
- Create a GitHub repo for this week's project and `git clone` it
- Read through the lab assignment, translating it into a to-do list, and fulfill some technical components such as:
  1. Create a basic scaffold for the project
  2. Utilize `if/else` statements to handle conditional logic
  3. Add in some basic input validation
  4. Utilize good Git processes including **a-c-p** cycles
