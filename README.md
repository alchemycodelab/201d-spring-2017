## Lecture Notes and Demo Code from Class

Any lecture notes and demo code will be placed in each class' `lecture/` and `demo/` subdirectories after they are presented. 

## Assignments

Lab-time code assignments follow each class time. You can find these assignments in the subdirectories of each class folder. Assignment content will vary from day to day, depending on the topic. Some of the lab assignments will be pair programming assignments.

Instructions for completing and submitting the assignments can be found in the README files of the appropriate subdirectories.

Assignments are submitted using a professional-grade git-flow. If you haven't done so already, it's time to get comfortable with the core git commands. Don't worry, we'll give you step by step help as needed.

## Class Repo Structure
This is your class repository (repo for short)! Check here for information about class lectures and labs. Here's a basic outline of how things are laid out.

- README.md (this file)
- Class-01/ 
    - README.md (overview of that class' topics and schedule)
    - slides/
        - any slides that accompany that class' lectures; not all lectures have slides
    - lecture/
        - lecture notes in a `.md` (markdown) file; updated after lecture
    - demo/
        - code written during lecture; updated after lecture
    - lab/
        - README.md (instructions for that class' lab)
- Class-02/ 
- Class-03/ 
- etc.

Each class has its own subdirectory that will be made available the day before.
