# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 15

Catch up with any overdue assignments, do some general review, and prep for project week!

## Prepare yourselves for project week
- Decide as a team on a project you're excited to work on! Think of a few possibilities (at least two) to discuss with SJ & SJ by end of day today. We'll help figure out what's in scope for project week.

- To keep in mind over the weekend: 
    - Monday, your team must submit a proposal with the following information:
        - Your team's name (if desired)
        - Your team's members
        - Your project's pitch. (What is the problem statement and what are the benefits of your solution? Read more about these [here](https://www.bidsketch.com/proposal-resources/proposal-templates/web-design-proposal-template).)
        - A diagram of relevant details from your project's domain model
        - A few wireframe sketches of your project's pages
        - A list of features marked as part of MVP or stretch goals.
