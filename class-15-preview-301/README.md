## Learning Objectives
- Collaborate with a group of people on the same GitHub repository by adding users to a repo.
- Know everything there is to know about jQuery. (Just kidding!)


## Notes
* Plan a project
    * Get an overall picture of where you're going, then BREAK it into managable chunks.
    * Your code should START SIMPLE. What's the LEAST you can do to try something and see if it works?
* Add collaborators to a GH Repo
    * in the repo page, go to `Settings > Collaborators & teams`
    * type in  your team mates' GitHub usernames, select them, and click the `Add Collaborator` button
