## Learning Objectives
- Store, retrieve, and access data stored in using the browser's local storage.
- Store and use data using JSON syntax and structure.

## Notes
* local storage
    * why isn't our data persistent?
    * built in browser storage
* UI and UX
    * user interface: how the user can interact with the web page
        * [goodui.org](http://www.goodui.org/)
    * user experience: how the interactions affect the user's perception and experience
