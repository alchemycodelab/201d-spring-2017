## Learning Objectives
- Create JavaScript objects that inherit properties using JavaScript prototype inheritance. 
- Add visually pleasing animations to a web page using CSS animations.

## Notes
* CSS Animations
    * [MDN animatable properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties)
    * Transitions ~ when an element changes state: on hover
    * Keyframes ~ not tied to a state change
        * [another useful article](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/css-animation-for-beginners)
* JS Inheritence
    * Create new objects that include another objects properties and methods
    * `Array.hasPropertyOf` comes from `Object.hasPropertyOf`
